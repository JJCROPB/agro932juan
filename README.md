###### This is a project that aims to perform a simulation of Next Generation Sequencing dataset in  two populations. 
###### -For that I used the reference genome of the ribosomeRNA and I transferRNA of Escherichia coli genes for 16S rRNA, 5S rRNA, 23S rRNA, tRNA-Ile, tRNA-Ala, partial and complete sequence https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/216643
###### -I used wgsim software https://github.com/lh3/wgsim to run the simulation
###### -First, I create this repository including some directories to organize the files
###### -Then, I cloned this repository in CRANE, a high performance cluster from UNL
###### -After that, I cloned and instaled the software wgsim into the repository in CRANE https://github.com/lh3/wgsim
###### -Once it was cloned, I downloaded the reference genome with 4481 bp and place it into the repository in CRANE https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/216643
###### -With the reference genome and the software installed, I ran this code to perform the data simulation using wgsim
